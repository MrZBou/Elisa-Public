Hey. I'm zbou, and I am the developer of this bot. And I really thank you for using my creation.
***
I have been developing Elisa alone since May 2020. Before that, I had no experience with discord bots, except for a simple bot for my server - *hetcher*. 
All he did was answer simple commands.

- Elisa was originally conceived as a musical bot, for its creation I was inspired by the Hydra bot. It was only approved for top.gg the 3rd time because it had so many bugs.

Elisa is now considered a multifunctional bot, which is also excellent of leveling and economics. 
With every update, I learn new details that help me learn JavaScript as well. 
I plan to keep updating my bot, as well as making it popular so that it can compete with popular bots.

About myself: I'm live in Russia and I am 16 years old, I am fond of programming, which is why I donâ€™t spend enough time studying in the college. 
Earlier, a year or two ago, I made a game in Roblox: "Zombies - Last Night". 
I also love to watch anime, my favorite is Bleach, but that is not so important :)

##### Thank you for attention. I hope you enjoy using my bot, and if so, I welcome your suggestions and bug reports. Because it is an easy task to search for errors in a code of thousands of lines alone. Goodbye!
